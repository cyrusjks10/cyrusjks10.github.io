## About Me

In May of 2022, I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science-Statistics, a major that involved training in applied statistical methods, data wrangling, data visualization, and data analysis more broadly. I have gained proficiency in Excel, SQL(PostgreSQL), R, and Python and am seeking opportunities to leverage data analysis to create and realize business insights and business value in the fields of Insurance and Finance.
